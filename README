=======

This project aims to provide input method for Lao/Esaan Tham script on various
frameworks.

FEATURES

 * Internal keyboard map(s).

 * Input sequence reordering, so that users can type text from left to right
   (with some exception like medial RA), and it will convert the sequence
   into Unicode phonetic order.

 * Input sequence check, so that orthographically invalid sequences are
   filtered out. The strictness of the filter can be configured (pass through,
   basic check, strict).
